# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

###Repo contains an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
* Downloads a file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzips it
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names (obtained from the activity_labels.txt file) to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names (obtained from the features.txt file). 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* Write the resulting tidy data set to a file.
